## About virtual-tree lib

lib contains low-level VirtualTree component that you can use to build your own virtual-tree with features that are needed (like custom infinite loader or theme). there is also a high level virtual tree component (HighLevelVirtualTree)
that requires only url string to fetch data and an onNodeSelected callback.
